# Amiami Notifier

Simple Python script that notifies user of item availability via search criteria on AmiAmi

use an `input.txt` file with line separated search queries

example:

```
fumofumo plush
blue archive figure
```

currently exists an issue with the amiami API where it cannot display queries with a large number of results


Working on github actions to automate search query
